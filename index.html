                <h1>Hi, I'm <b>Nicole</b></h1>
                <p>
                I completed my Associate of Web Development degree at Riverland Community College in Austin, Minnesota in 2020.
                <br>
                <br>
                My passion for computers started at a young age, and I gained a renewed interest during college when I took my first programming course.
                During my time in college, I had the chance to work with HTML, CSS, Javascript, MySQL, graphic design, and Python. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest technological advances and trends, and my curiousity is never ending!
                <br>
                <br>
                Thank you for looking at my portfolio, and I look forward to working with you.
                </p>
